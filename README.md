The Coe Water Quality Lab has been studying eastern Iowa surface waters for over twenty years. Led by professor of chemistry and environmental studies Marty St. Clair, over eighty undergraduates have taken part in this effort to provide data to decision makers and citizens. Find out more at the lab [website](https://cwql.weebly.com/). For more information on the importance of the different parameters measured, see YSI’s [website](https://www.ysi.com/parameters). To compare to values from Iowa, take a look at the Iowa Department of Natural Resource’s [compilation](http://publications.iowa.gov/23899/1/WFS-2017-02.pdf) of data from 2000-2016.

This dashoard was created by Brian Cochran during the Cornell College Summer Research Institute with Professor Tyler George. CSRI is an eight week summer program during which students work with faculty members on various projects. For more information about CSRI see Cornell College's [website](https://www.cornellcollege.edu/academic-affairs/faculty-development/internal/summer-research.shtml).
